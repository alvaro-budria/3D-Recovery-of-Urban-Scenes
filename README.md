# 3D Reconstruction of Urban Scenes


## Overview
This repository contains the code for the "3D Recovery of Urban Scenes" project from the Master in Computer Vision at UAB (Module 4: 3D Vision).

The project focuses on reconstructing 3D models of buildings using multiple images taken from different perspectives, including frontal fa√ßade images and aerial images. The tasks involve rectifying perspective distortion, estimating essential and fundamental matrices, calibrating cameras with planar patterns, estimating depth, generating new views, and creating 3D models using calibrated or uncalibrated cameras (SfM).

To understand the complete pipeline, refer to the specific code directory and technical report for each week's delivery (listed below).


## Deliverables

The project is divided into five different weekly deliveries, each contributing to the overall pipeline. Below are the links to the respective weeks' code and explanations:


### Week 1: Planar Transformations and Image Rectification
